# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree - Project 8 - Exploratory Data Analysis in R
In this project, I use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques in a selected dataset (Prosper Loan) to discover relationships among multiple variables, and create explanatory visualizations illuminating distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

Objectives of this project:
 - Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
 - Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
 - Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
 - Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information
